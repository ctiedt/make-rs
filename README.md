# make-rs

A simple subset of `make` implemented in Rust without dependencies.

# Differences to gnu make

This is really just a small subset of the capabilities of gnu `make`
and just intended to show that such a thing can be built in Rust without
external dependencies.

Missing features:

- command line flags
- timestamp checking
- parallel compilation
